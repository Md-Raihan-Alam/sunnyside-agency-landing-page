# sunnyside-agency-landing-page

--It is a first big project I took on myself after completing freecodecamp projects

--As it is lading page the main work was on html and css. JS us used but not much

--The little difficult that I face was when animating menu option. I faced a few bugs while making it
   -- some bugs were like the text disappeared before  the animation finished
   -- the whole menu was gone before the animation got complete
   -- when i fix the bug of sliding up menu, sliding down menu star showing some bugs.

--The problem was I could not time all the code that was excuting on JS part for animation orderly. Some code was excuting before the other got excuted at time cause of animation
  so I solved the problem by using Timeout. Which was very usefull here
 
--It is responsive for both mobile and dekstop

--This project is properly created by html, css and js

--Coded from scratch by Md. Raihan Alam(me).
